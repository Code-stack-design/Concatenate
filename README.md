# Java Array Concatenation Program

This Java console application showcases how to concatenate two integer arrays provided by the user.

##  Description

##  Features

- Reads input array sizes and elements from the user via `Scanner`.
- Displays both original arrays.
- Concatenates arrays using manual indexing (with no additional dependencies or Java 8+ features).
- Prints the concatenated result on the console.
